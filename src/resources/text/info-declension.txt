A guide to declension table 
	1. For nouns and adjectives, the list comes from the Concise PƒÅli-English Dictionary. All declined terms are derived from calculation against known paradigms. If the input term is not in the dictionary and its ending is declinable, the calculation is based on generic paradigms. In this case, the Compute button has to be pressed.
	2. For pronouns, the list is prepared separately, excluding number 1-4 which are also counted as pronouns by the tradition.
	3. For numbers, the user can select a term from the list provided, either cardinal or ordinal number. If a number is entered in the text field, the output is calculated correspondingly. Any number can be tested, up to 6 digits.
	4. The result is shown for one gender at a time. If the term can be declined in multiple genders, a specific gender has to be chosen. See the radio buttons marked with m, f, and nt.
	5. The user can check the terms declined against a term list either from the whole list or the main Tokenizer by opening the right side list with the button provided.
