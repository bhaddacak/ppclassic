An effective search guide
	1. Select dictionaries to be included in a search first.
	2. In immediate mode, the search starts as soon as the first character is entered. This can be slow at first because many terms will be retrieved. The scope will be norrowed down quickly when the second and third character are entered subsequently.
	3. If immediate search is not suitable, check 'Use */?' to enter wildcard mode. Here you have to explicitly add * (any characters including none) and/or ? (any one character) to the query, e.g. bud*, buddh?. The wildcards can be used more than once and can appear in any position. In this mode you have to press Enter or Search button to submit the query. Retrieving all records by supplying only * is not allowed.
	4. If you want to search in the meanings, check 'In meaning'. This search is not immediate and wildcards are not to be used. The search simply matches the query in any part of the meaning of the books selected.
	5. With a technical limitation, highlighting the result is not implemented. You can explore the result further, e.g. finding a word, by pressing the Pencil button to open the result in the Editor.
