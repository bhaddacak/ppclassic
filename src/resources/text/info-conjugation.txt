A guide to conjugation table
	1. The verbs listed here are selected because they are well-documented in the traditional textbooks. Some of them cover many verb forms, tenses, and moods, e.g. pacati, gacchati, and bhavati. These are good learning materials. But some have only a few forms because they are not used variously in the texts.
	2. Attanopada (middle voice) forms are also shown only the documented ones. You may experiment with these forms with a custom stem (see below).
	3. Augment (a-) is added only to some of Imperfect verbs and all of Aorist, and Conditional verbs. The augment has no specific meaning, so it is a redundant part. However, it is fashionable to be used with some verbs.
	4. The experiment with a custom stem utilizes only generic paradigms in computation. So, the results look mathematical and impractical, but it is a good tool to gain a general idea of verb formation. 
	5. The user can check the terms rendered against a term list, either from the whole list or the main Tokenizer window by opening the right side list with the button provided.
