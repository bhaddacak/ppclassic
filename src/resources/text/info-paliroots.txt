Notes on Pāli roots
	1. The list of Pāli roots was taken from "Pali Roots in Saddanīti Dhātu-Mālā compared with Pāṇinīya-Dhātupāṭha" by Ven. U Silananda. Only the Pāli part is presented here.
	2. There are some comments referring to the Smith's edition of Saddanīti, marked by * in the root list and ** in the meaning list. To see the comments, click the item with the marks. The comments are put here verbatim. So, some are difficult to understand. For more information, please consult the original works.
