A quick guide to Pāli prosody
	1. There are two main types of Pāli prosody: (1) those which are counted by meters (mattāvutti), and (2) those which are counted by syllables (vaññavutti). There are also several subtypes of these as shown in the table.
	2. The basic meter of a syllable can be light (lahu = 1 or l) or strong (garu = 2 or g). A short vowel unfollowed by ṃ or double consonants is counted as lahu, otherwise garu.
	3. Groups in mattāvutti are represented by lowercase characters: n (1111), s (112), j (121), b (211), m (22), 4 (any of the above five), 6 (any + g or ll), 8 (any combination of the five), 2 (g or ll).
	4. Groups in vaññavutti are represented by uppercase characters: N (111), S (112), J (121), Y (122), B (211), R (212), T (221), M (222), L (14 lahus).
	5. Other symbols used in patterns are: | (or), ! (not), ; (line separator), - (mere separator to ease the reading).
	6. The analysis can be done by copying some text and hitting Analyze button. It can also be called by the Pāli document viewer using a right-click over a selected text portion.
	7. When the result is shown, at the end of pattern lines is summation, e.g. '(16/24)' means 16 syllables/24 meter-units.
	8. When 'incomplete' is shown, it means the pattern requires more data to analyze. It can happen when the pattern need 2 lines but only 1 line is processed.
	9. When 'over-required' is shown, it means the input is longer than the pattern required.
	10. When a long line is copied, it can be truncated, marked by '...'. It is not supposed to be a verse.
