How to find a document
	1. There are roughly two modes of finding: (1) search in document's information as shown in TOC tree, and (2) search in document's contents (full text search).
	2. Document's information can be divided into three fields: text name, book name, and group name. The user has to choose the search target properly. In this mode, only an asterisk (*) can be used as a wildcard in any position, and the search is case-insensitive. The result of this is shown immediately.
	3. In content search, a regular-expression pattern can be used as a search query. In this mode, all special characters are interpreted as regex meta-characters, and the user has to press Enter to submit the query. This search is case-sensitive, and at least three characters are allowed as a query. The last column of the result shows the number of instances found in each document.
	4. To search a whole word in this mode, '\b' can be used to mark the word boundary, For example, "\bdhammā\b" matches "dhammā" not "xxxdhammāxxx". Remember that complex regex patterns take time to process.
	5. The content search is brute and slow, and always finds in a fixed order, i.e., Vinaya, Suttanta, Abhidhamma, and Añña group respectively. For a more refined search, consider using Lucene Finder or Tokenizer.
	6. To narrow down the source and speed up the search, the inclusion of text groups should be set appropriately.
